# Trello QA Project

This repository contains a complete manual QA project performed on Trello’s web application.  
The goal of this project was to test core board and card management functionalities, document results, identify defects, and perform a full regression cycle.

## Project Components
- **Test Plan** – Scope, out-of-scope, environment, and testing approach  
- **Test Cases** – Functional test cases for sorting, renaming, and board/card operations  
- **Bug Log** – Documented defects with severity, reproduction notes, and updated statuses  
- **Execution Logs** – Pass/Fail results from initial test cycle  
- **Regression Testing** – Verification of developer fixes and post-fix test cycle summary

## Highlights
- Identified two high-severity defects in sorting functionality  
- Designed and executed a complete regression cycle after simulated developer fixes  
- Built full QA documentation from scratch, including planning, execution, and closure  
- Demonstrated industry-standard QA processes using Trello as the test application  

## Tools Used
- Chrome Browser  
- Trello Web Application  
- Markdown for documentation  
- GitHub for portfolio presentation  

This project demonstrates the ability to perform end-to-end manual QA work:  
**planning → execution → bug reporting → regression → documentation.**
