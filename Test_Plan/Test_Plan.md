# Test Plan – Trello Web App

## 1\. Purpose

The purpose of testing Trello is to ensure it functions as a reliable and organized workspace for managing tasks. The focus of this testing effort is on validating core features related to organization and consistency, and confirming that primary workflows operate without functional bugs.

## 2\. Scope

The following Trello features will be included in the testing scope:

* Manual card sorting within lists
* Handling large quantities of cards (100+)
* Card order consistency after page refresh
* Built-in Auto-Sort options (e.g., alphabetical, due date)
* Renaming boards, lists, or cards
* Creating new boards
* Creating and running basic Automation Rules (free-tier allowed actions only)



## 3\. Out of Scope

The following areas will not be included in this testing effort:

* Performance or load testing
* Testing of Trello's mobile application
* Premium features that are not available on free accounts
* Advanced or restricted automation actions that require a paid plan



## 4\. Environment

⦁	New Trello Account
⦁	Chrome on Windows
⦁	Trello Browser Version

## 5\. Testing Approach

I will run a series of 15-20 Manual Test Cases. Major functionality tests will be repeated for assurance. Everything will be documented from bug reports, reviews, pass/fail tests.
